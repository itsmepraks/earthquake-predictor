App overview:

The app is an earthquake predictor for the Dataset of Nepal. 

The goal of the app is to showcase ML algorithms and techiniques described in the [proposal.md](mdc:proposal.md)

We will be using Python and streamlit for the development. 

Use the prototype folder for simple scripts to test out or show case individual techniques.

Update the [whitepaper.md](mdc:whitepaper.md) as we progress.
